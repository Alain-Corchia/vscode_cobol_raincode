# bitlang.COBOL - Questionnaire

If you have a spare couple of minutes, I would appreciate it if you could complete my questionnaire @ [Google Form Link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScf7xIL2xc6leESzVVJH55Gufe1QoooE7G5pzoCDItOi5JlHg/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1100987930=No&entry.305553560=Yes&entry.1168732002=3&entry.1481499705=3&entry.575472136=3&entry.1667323397=3&entry.1126035919=3&entry.1982811693=3&entry.587605597=3).

TIP: If you are interested in using the *Micro Focus COBOL* extension with this extension, take a look at the [COBOL-Switcher](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bitlang.cobol-switcher) extension.   It's aim is to allow you to switch between the two COBOL language editors.   It also documents useful configuration options as well.
