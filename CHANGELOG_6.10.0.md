# COBOL Source editing for Visual Studio Code

## Changes: 6.10.0

- Bulk processing of metadata caching has been moved out of the vscode process to enable a more responsive editing experience using nodejs/fork
- COBOLDoc support has been removed, awaiting completion of issues raised with the COBOLDoc project itself, once these issues have been resolved the support can be re-instated.
- COBOL Listing file support has been split out into compiler-specific variants allow custom colourisation for each style of listing file
